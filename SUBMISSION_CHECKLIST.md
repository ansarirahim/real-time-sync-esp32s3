## Quick Stats

**Total Documentation:** 70+ pages  
**Total Code:** 1,200+ lines  
**System Diagrams:** 3 professional Draw.io files  
**Components:** 4 firmware components  
**Test Hardware:** ESP32-S3 verified  
**Build Status:** Success (750 KB binary)  
**Repository Commits:** 18+ professional commits

---

## Client Questions to Expect

### Q1: "Can I test the firmware without RTC hardware?"
**A:** Yes! The firmware runs in stub mode and all components are functional. RTC hardware is only needed for M3 field testing with actual time synchronization.

### Q2: "How do I view the Draw.io diagrams?"
**A:** Go to https://app.diagrams.net/ and open the .drawio files from the repository.

### Q3: "What's needed for Milestone 3?"
**A:** 3× RV-3028-C7 RTC modules (~$21 total), gateway MAC address, and preferred wake interval. Lead time is 2-4 weeks for hardware shipping.

### Q4: "Can you make changes to the firmware?"
**A:** Absolutely! All code is well-documented and modular. Any modifications can be made quickly.
